Welcome to the Markdown Server
==============================

This is a simple [ASP.NET MVC][1] application that serves up [Markdown][2] (powered by [MarkdownSharp][3]).  To add extra content, simply place your Markdown files (\*.md) in the *App_Data* folder.

Visit the [features](features.md) section to find out what's new and what's next.

Markdown
--------
Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

We love Markdown, so does [github][4] and [stackoverflow][5].  We intend to use a lot more of it in the future.
